The job of the load balancer is to fairly divide all client requests among the pool of available servers. Load balancers perform this job to avoid overloading or crashing servers.
However, for increasing client requests, load balancers provide the following capabilities:

Scalability: By adding servers, the capacity of the application/service can be increased seamlessly. 
Availability: Even if some servers go down or suffer a fault, the system still remains available. 
Performance: Load balancers can forward requests to servers with a lesser load so the user can get a quicker response time.
