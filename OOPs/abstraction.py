'''
The main goal of the abstract base class is to provide a standardized way to test 
whether an object adheres to a given specification. 
It can also prevent any attempt to instantiate a subclass that doesnâ€™t override 
a particular method in the superclass. And finally, using an abstract class, 
a class can derive identity from another class without any object inheritance.

>> you cant create object from abstract class.
>> ABstraction is not directly supported in python irectly but 
we can use abc(abstract base class) module.
