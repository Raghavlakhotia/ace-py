'''
Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. 
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, 
and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.

Let us see the access modifiers in Python to understand the concept of Encapsulation and data hiding âˆ’

public -> accessible from inside or outside the class.
private(__variable) -> accessible from inside the class.
protected(__variable) -> accessible from inside the class and its sub-class.
